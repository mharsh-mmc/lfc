## API Endpoints

### Video Management
- `POST /videos` - Upload new video
- `GET /videos/{id}` - Get video details
- `PUT /videos/{id}` - Update video caption
- `DELETE /videos/{id}` - Delete video
- `GET /users/{id}/videos` - Get user's videos

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "video": {
    "id": 1,
    "caption": "Video Title",
    "url": "/storage/videos/video.mp4",
    "thumbnail": "/storage/thumbnails/1.jpg",
    "duration": 120,
    "file_size": 1048576,
    "mime_type": "video/mp4",
    "created_at": "2025-01-27T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Thumbnails Not Showing
1. **Check FFmpeg Installation**:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ffprobe -version
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker --execute="echo env('FFMPEG_PATH');"
   ```

3. **Check Thumbnails Directory**:
   ```bash
   ls storage/app/public/thumbnails/
   ```

4. **Review Logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```

### Upload Issues
1. **File Size**: Ensure video is under 500MB
2. **File Format**: Check if format is supported
3. **Storage Permissions**: Ensure storage directory is writable
4. **CSRF Token**: Verify CSRF token is included in requests

### Performance Issues
1. **Large Files**: Consider implementing chunked uploads
2. **Thumbnail Generation**: May take time for large videos
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor server memory during processing

## Security Considerations

### File Validation
- MIME type checking
- File extension validation
- File size limits
- User-specific storage isolation

### Access Control
- User authentication required
- User can only access their own videos
- CSRF protection on all uploads

### Storage Security
- Files stored outside web root
- Direct access to video files restricted
- Thumbnails served through Laravel routes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Video compression for faster loading
- [ ] Multiple thumbnail generation (different timestamps)
- [ ] Video preview in upload modal
- [ ] Batch upload functionality
- [ ] Video categories/tags
- [ ] Video sharing between users
- [ ] Video comments and likes
- [ ] Advanced video player controls

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Lazy loading for large galleries
- [ ] Video streaming for large files
- [ ] CDN integration for video delivery
- [ ] Background job processing for thumbnails
- [ ] Video transcoding for web compatibility
